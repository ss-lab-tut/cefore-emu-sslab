# CeforeEmu Context

CeforeEmu emulates Content-Centric Networking (Cefore) deployments on Mininet. This glossary fixes the project-specific language so code and future architecture reviews stay consistent. General programming concepts are intentionally excluded.

## Command execution

**CommandRunner**:
The single seam through which every command sent to a Mininet host (or the root namespace) is executed. Owns argv execution, output redirection, and the lifecycle of long-running processes. Has two adapters: a real Mininet-backed one and a recording fake for tests.
_Avoid_: shell helper, exec wrapper, "host.cmd()" path

**CommandResult**:
The value a CommandRunner returns for a finished command: `returncode`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `log_path`. Deadline/cancellation is expressed through the `timed_out`/`cancelled` flags, not through a sentinel returncode.
_Avoid_: output, return tuple, proc result

**CommandHandle**:
The token a CommandRunner returns for a still-running command. Callers wait/poll/terminate/kill it through the runner; they never hold a raw `Popen`.
_Avoid_: proc, process handle, popen object

## Host identity

**Node name**:
The canonical identifier of a host in runner and config interfaces — the string `"h{idx}"` (e.g. `"h3"`). This is the one identity used everywhere; integer host indices are an internal/topology detail, not an interface identity.
_Avoid_: host index, idx, host id (as an interface argument)

**Root sentinel**:
The reserved Node name that tells the CommandRunner to execute in the root namespace (plain subprocess) instead of a host netns. Used by bridge/external-network setup.
_Avoid_: root ns flag, "root" special case

## Experiment results

**Verdict**:
The single judgment of one experiment operation's outcome (put/get/pub/sub). Owns the per-op success criteria, the completed-marker and failure-pattern strings, and the Factors. Lives in `src/core/verdict.py`; every consumer (results.json records, CSV log pipeline, autotest analyze, smoke checker) reads recorded Verdict Factors instead of re-deriving success. Produced through three adapters: runtime (CommandResult + log + artifacts), log-only (post-hoc log text; unseen Factors stay unknown), stored-factors (a results.json record).
_Avoid_: success detection, detect result, classify result

**Factor**:
One named piece of Verdict evidence (`has_completed_log`, `has_output_file`, exit status). Tri-state: `True`, `False`, or `None` meaning unknown *or* not-applicable for that op type (e.g. completed-marker for pub/sub). A Factor that is `None` is never counted as a failure reason. Each op type has a definitive Factor for log-only judgment (get: completed-marker; put: result fields + no failure pattern); ops without an in-log definitive Factor (sub/pub) stay unknown there.
_Avoid_: flag, boolean column

**ResultsRecord**:
One judgment entry in results.json — a tagged union of two shapes: ContentRecord (one per put/get/pub/sub; 14 fixed keys carrying the Verdict Factors) and EventRecord (one per non-content scheduler event or host flap). Defined in `src/core/records.py`; the on-disk key sets are frozen — every reader (autotest analyze, smoke checker, webui) depends on them.
_Avoid_: result dict, record dict, results entry

**ResultsSink**:
The single seam through which every ResultsRecord is produced, accumulated, and written. Owns construction from (Verdict + op context) — including `ts` and `publisher_down` derivation — thread-safe accumulation, subscriber broadcast (webui dashboard), and the results.json write. Two adapters: the real sink and a recording fake for tests. Monitoring's observation stream stays outside it (ADR-0001).
_Avoid_: result callback, results list, `_append_result`
